About me
======
Vivek specialized research focusses on Emissions control techniques and algorithms to improve engine efficiency and meet emission standards. This includes new OBD analysis techniques for Exhaust Gas Recirculation, Gasoline Particulate Filter controls on hybrid vehicles, plug-in hybrids, mild hybrids, and Conventional Gasoline engines. My Findings progress other researchers understanding of next generation powertrain actuators and sensors as it applies to electronic devices and Hybrid electric vehicles ,particularly in the electronics and automotive industries of the United states needed in achieving decreased Particulate emissions and increase Powertrain efficiency.
